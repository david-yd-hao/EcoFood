## Description
### Who we are?
We are four CS undergraduate students from Cambridge, Duke and UIUC participating in the OpenAI Hackathon for Climate Change.

### What EcoFood is?
EcoFood is a search engine for recipes based on queries of ingredients:
1. Recommends recipes that include the queried ingredient based on total carbon footprint
  - Use Dall-E to generate images of recipes
  - Rank a few recipes based on the total carbon footprint and water footprint
  - Allow entering of multiple desired ingredients
2. Option to shop the ingredients there and then
  - Business Idea: partner with businesses (affiliate partnerships) to offer monetary incentives (commissions) based on carbon footprint saved
